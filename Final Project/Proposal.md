#Group 5 - Lab Fire Final Project Proposal

##Intro/context – What is the problem? Why is it important?
Current AguaClara technology utilizes enclosed stacked rapid sand filters (ESTaRS) which itself an innovation upon traditional rapid sand filters that saves floor space. It does so by placing several beds of sand on top of one another between inlet and outlet pipes. However, it is possible that even more space could be conserved by reducing the height of each bed of sand. It is important because a part of AguaClara's mission is to create the most affordable technology possible without compromising on the quality of the water that is produced. This research project seeks to discover if sand bed depths as low as 15 cm are feasible options.

##Objectives – What is the hypothesis? What will you do to test the hypothesis?
ESTaRS currently uses 20 cm of sand for each bed, which is lower than the current industry standard of ____. That depth was arbitrarily chosen (check with Monroe on this one). Since there was no significant adverse effect of the function of the sand filters(also check with Monroe), it is likely that it could be reduced even further.

If the sand bed depth is reduced from 20cm to 15cm the sand filter will not fail within (certain period of time).

Group 5 (Lab fire) will test this hypothesis by running experiments, varying the depth of the sand filter bed, and controlling for flow rate, backwash flow rate, and influent turbidity.

##Experimental plan including – How will you measure it?
To measure time to failure, the team will be continuously measuring turbidity at the effluent. Failure is defined at 1 NTU, at which point the backwash mechanism is activated to clean the sand filter. To compare the efficiency of each bed using different influent contaminant concentrations, the team members will compare the time it takes for each system to fail.

##Key design parameters
1. Filter Heights: 30cm, 20cm, and 15cm sand filters
2. Flow Rates:
3. Contaminant Concentrations:

##Timeline of tasks/experiments
Since we will be testing three different filter heights, we are planning on testing one height every week. Therefore, the schedule would look like this:

Table 1: Experiment Schedule

| Date | Procedure |
|:--------:|:-----:|
| Friday, April 12 | Setup apparatus |
| Monday, April 15 | Setup 30 cm filter, prepare contaminant solutions |
| Wednesday, April 17 | Run 30 cm filter experiment |
| Friday, April 19 | Evaluate results from 30 cm filter experiment |
| Monday, April 22 | Setup 20 cm filter, prepare contaminant solutions |
| Wednesday, April 24 | Run 20 cm filter experiment |
| Friday, April 26 | Evaluate results from 20 cm filter experiment |
| Monday, April 29 | Setup 15 cm filter, prepare contaminant solutions |
| Wednesday, May 1 | Run 15 cm filter experiment |
| Friday, May 3 | Evaluate results from 15 cm filter experiment |
| Monday, May 6 | Prepare report, ask questions |


##Possible hurdles/challenges
Automating the experiment using ProCoda is preferable so that the members of Group 5 do not have to be present at all times. However this may prove to be a challenge because neither members are familiar enough with the program to program such code that would automate.

##Refs to primary, review, and other literature and possibly to previous years’ projects

##Resources needed to conduct experiments – What tools will you use?
TBD
What kind of tubing?
How much pipe/tubing?
One pump
How many valves?
How much sand (prob not a lot)
Turbidimeter
How much clay?

##Expectations/Anticipated results
The expected results are that the sand filters, despite having reduced sand bed depths, function reasonably well by not reaching failure mode within a certain period of time.
