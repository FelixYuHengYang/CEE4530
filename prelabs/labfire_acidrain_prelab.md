1. How many grams of $NaHCO3$ would be required to keep the ANC levels in a lake above 50 μeq/L for 3 hydraulic residence times given an influent pH of 3.0 and a lake volume of 4 L, if the current lake ANC is 0 μeq/L?

The first assumption that we made was that the $ANC_{in}$ was equal to the negative concentraiton of H+ ions. This was determined to be -0.001. We also assume that the reactor is completely mixed, so concentration of ANC in the lake and coming out of the lake is equivalent. Lastly, we assuemed residence time was also assumed to be 15 minutes. 

$Q(ANC_{in}−ANC_{out})=V\frac{d(ANC)}{dt}$

$ANC_{out}=ANC_{in}[1+e^{-t/\theta}]+ANC_{o}e^{(-t/\theta)}$

$ANC_o =\frac{ 0.00005+0.001[1-e^{-3}]}{e^{-3}}$

$ANC_o = 0.02 \frac{meq}{L}$

$[NaHCO_3]_{o} = ANC_o$

$\frac{ANC_o}{L} 84\frac{mg}{mmole}*4L=6.75 grams \:of \: [NaHCO_3]$

Thus 6.75 grams of [NaHCO_3] is required to keep ANC levels in a lake above 50 50 μeq/L for 45 minutes.
